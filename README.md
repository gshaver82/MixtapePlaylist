It has never been more important than it is right now to stay connected with friends and share parts of your life, so we created a fast and easy way to share with friends / family your current music rotation.

Mixtape is a social media music sharing website built on node-express and MySQL. It has a simple interface for sharing and voting on playlist. We want the user to be solely focused on the music, and so we designed a fun and easy-to-use, mobile-friendly website for just that. We use cutting-edge Argon2 encryption to keep our user information safe, and the PassportJS for front to back user authentication.

```
AS A Mobile or Desktop USER I want to find and create a playlist of my music choices
I WANT to be able to post, view, and vote on other users playlists
SO THAT I can enjoy new playlists and share my own playlists
